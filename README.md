- I'm Teodor. "wlkwos" is a scholarly approximation for what "wolf" would have sounded like in Proto-Indo-European.
- I'm interested in mathematics, algorithms, artificial intelligence, machine learning. Also human history, natural history, music theory... too many to list
- I'm currently learning Golang
- I’m looking to collaborate on any machine learning project, especially in Python or Java
- You can find me at teodordanton@gmail.com
